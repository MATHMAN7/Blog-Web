                Welcome to my personal space.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am a dedicated Computer Science student and developer with hands-on experience building websites, web and desktop applications, and managing databases like PostgreSQL. Proficient in C++, Java, JavaScript(React), and Python, I continually expand my skills through formal coursework at university and self-driven projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                Driven by a strong work ethic and a calm, friendly approach, I take pride in delivering reliable, efficient solutions. Feel free to explore my projects, learn more about me, or get in touch.
