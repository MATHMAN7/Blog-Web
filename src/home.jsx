                 Welcome to my personal space.
             </p>
             <p className="pabout">
                 I am a dedicated Computer Science student and developer with
                 hands-on experience building websites, web and desktop applications,
                 and managing databases like PostgreSQL. Proficient in C++, Java,
                 JavaScript(React), and Python, I continually expand my skills through
                 formal coursework at university and self-driven projects.

             <p className="pabout">
                 Driven by a strong work ethic and a calm, friendly approach, I take
                 pride in delivering reliable, efficient solutions. Feel free to explore
                 my projects, learn more about me, or get in touch.
